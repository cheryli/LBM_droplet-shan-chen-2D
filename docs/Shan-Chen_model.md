[**Back to the introduction.**](https://cheryli.github.io/LBM_droplet-shan-chen-2D)

You can also refer to the original thesis: [Shan and Chen(1993)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.47.1815) and [Shan and Chen(1994)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.2941), and this model has been developed for many years so a review of recent researches using this model is necessary for its best performance.
